        <S.SectionTitle>What Are Stocks? (Simply Explained)</S.SectionTitle>
        <S.Paragraph>
          Stocks (also known as shares) are basically small pieces of a company
          that you can own. When you buy a stock, you become a shareholder,
          which means you're a part owner of that company. It's like owning a
          tiny slice of a big business.
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.Paragraph>
          Think of it this way: imagine you started a small bakery, and your
          friend gives you money to help it grow. Your friend becomes a part
          owner of the bakery. They won't be baking the cakes or running the
          shop every day – they're more like a silent partner – but because they
          invested money, they get to share in the bakery's success. This is
          similar to how stocks work. You invest in a company by buying stocks,
          and in return, you own a piece of it without having to work there.
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.Paragraph>
          For example, let's say you buy shares of Lucky Cement, which is a
          large cement company. By buying its stock, you become a small owner of
          Lucky Cement. If the company does well – say it sells a lot of cement
          and makes good profits – the value of your shares can go up. The
          company might even share some of its profits with you by paying
          dividends. But if Lucky Cement has a bad year and loses money, the
          value of your stock could go down. As a shareholder, you share in both
          the ups and downs of the company.
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.Paragraph>
          In short, here are some key things to know about stocks:
        </S.Paragraph>
        <S.BulletList>
          <S.BulletItem>
            When you buy a stock, you become a part owner of that company (a
            shareholder).
          </S.BulletItem>
          <S.BulletItem>
            Companies sell stocks to the public to raise money to grow or
            improve their business.
          </S.BulletItem>
          <S.BulletItem>
            If the company does well, its stock price usually goes up. This
            means you can potentially sell your stock for a profit. The company
            might also pay shareholders a portion of its profits, called
            dividends.
          </S.BulletItem>
          <S.BulletItem>
            If the company does poorly, its stock price can go down. This means
            your investment loses value, which is the risk you take as an
            investor.
          </S.BulletItem>
        </S.BulletList>

        <S.Paragraph>
          "Every big company was once a small business. Owning stocks lets you
          be part of their growth story."
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.SectionTitle>Why Do People Buy Stocks?</S.SectionTitle>

        <S.Paragraph>
          Imagine you put Rs. 100,000 in a bank account today. With inflation in
          Pakistan often crossing 20%, after one year your money will lose much
          of its real buying power. You might still have Rs. 100,000 on paper,
          but what you can buy with it will shrink.
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.Paragraph>
          Stocks give you a way out of this slow loss. By investing in strong
          companies, your money can not only keep up with inflation but actually
          grow much faster than it. When businesses grow bigger, your share of
          their success grows too.
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.Paragraph>
          Just like you trust a shopkeeper to grow his shop over time, you trust
          professional companies — banks, cement factories, tech giants — to
          expand and increase your investment value. You don't need to run the
          business yourself. You simply ride along as an owner.
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.BulletList>
          <S.BulletItem>
            <strong>Grow Your Money:</strong> Stocks have historically delivered
            better returns than savings accounts, real estate, or gold over long
            periods. For example, Systems Limited (SYS) shares have grown more
            than 1000% over the last decade.
          </S.BulletItem>
          <S.BulletItem>
            <strong>Earn Dividends:</strong> Many companies pay cash rewards
            (dividends) from their profits. It's like getting a bonus simply for
            being a part-owner — Meezan Bank (MEBL) and FFC are examples of good
            dividend payers.
          </S.BulletItem>
          <S.BulletItem>
            <strong>Own Great Businesses:</strong> Stocks let you own pieces of
            daily life companies — like the bank you use (HBL, MCB), the food
            you eat (Engro Foods), or the mobile services you depend on (PTCL).
          </S.BulletItem>
        </S.BulletList>

        <S.Paragraph>
          In simple words: Stocks turn you from just a consumer into an owner.
          Instead of only spending on businesses, you can now grow rich
          alongside them.

        <S.SectionTitle>How Do Stocks Work in Pakistan?</S.SectionTitle>

        <S.Paragraph>
          In Pakistan, stocks are traded on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX),
          headquartered in Karachi. It's one of the oldest and most important
          stock exchanges in South Asia, where more than 500 companies from
          different sectors like banking, cement, oil, and technology are
          listed.
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.Paragraph>
          When a company wants to raise money, it issues shares to the public
          through a process called an Initial Public Offering (IPO). Once the
          IPO is complete, these shares are bought and sold every day between
          investors through the PSX platform.
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.Paragraph>
          Trading today is fully digital. You don’t need to physically go
          anywhere — you can buy or sell shares through your broker's online
          platform or mobile app with just a few taps.
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.Paragraph>
          The price of a stock changes every second based on supply and demand:
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.BulletList>
          <S.BulletItem>
            <strong>Price goes up:</strong> When more people want to buy the
            stock than sell it — usually because the company is performing well,
            or there’s positive news about its future.
          </S.BulletItem>
          <S.BulletItem>
            <strong>Price falls:</strong> When more people want to sell the
            stock than buy it — often because of poor company performance,
            negative economic news, or political instability.
          </S.BulletItem>
          <S.BulletItem>
            <strong>Trading is fast and accessible:</strong> Thanks to mobile
            apps offered by brokers like AKD Securities, JS Global, MRA
            Securities, and others, you can monitor stock prices live, place
            orders, and manage your portfolio anywhere, anytime.
          </S.BulletItem>
        </S.BulletList>

        <S.Paragraph>
          The entire stock market is supervised by the Securities and Exchange
          Commission of Pakistan (SECP), a government body that regulates
          brokers, companies, and investors to ensure transparency, fairness,
          and protection against fraud.
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.Paragraph>
          For example, if a company wants to issue fake shares or manipulate
          prices, SECP can fine them, delist them, or even take legal action.
          This helps maintain trust in the market and protects small investors
          like you and me.
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.Paragraph>
          It's important to remember: the PSX operates from Monday to Friday,
          from 9:30 AM to 3:30 PM, and remains closed on weekends and public
          holidays. You can place orders during these hours or schedule future
          trades through your app.
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.Paragraph>
          In short, Pakistan's stock market system today is modern, fast, secure
          — and open for every citizen to participate in wealth building.

          The Reality of Pakistan’s Stock Market: Big Players, Insider Trading,
          and Retailers
        </S.SectionTitle>

        <S.Paragraph>
          While the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) offers genuine wealth-building
          opportunities, it's important to understand that not everything runs
          perfectly. Like many emerging markets, Pakistan’s stock market
          sometimes faces issues like insider trading, price manipulation, and
          market cornering.
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.Paragraph>
          Powerful investors, wealthy groups, and big brokers have historically
          had significant influence over certain stocks. Sometimes, they
          accumulate large quantities of a stock, artificially create buying
          pressure, and then sell at high prices, leaving small investors stuck
          at the top.
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.Paragraph>
          Insider trading — where company insiders secretly buy or sell shares
          based on confidential information — has also hurt regular investors in
          Pakistan in the past. SECP tries to regulate and catch offenders, but
          as a small investor, you need to protect yourself.
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.Paragraph>
          <strong>How can you beat this malpractice?</strong>
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.BulletList>
          <S.BulletItem>
            Stick to strong, fundamentally sound companies with real profits and
            assets.
          </S.BulletItem>
          <S.BulletItem>
            Ignore short-term rumors, "hot stock tips," or sudden pump-and-dump
            movements.
          </S.BulletItem>
          <S.BulletItem>
            Focus on long-term growth, dividends, and stability, not quick
            profits.
          </S.BulletItem>
          <S.BulletItem>
            Use simple filters: high dividend payers, low debt, consistent
            profits, trusted management.
          </S.BulletItem>
        </S.BulletList>

        <S.Paragraph>
          Remember, manipulation usually works on low-volume, unknown stocks.
          When you invest in major companies — the blue chips of Pakistan — it
          becomes extremely difficult for manipulators to trap you.
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.Paragraph>
          Stay smart, stay patient — and no "group" can control your destiny.

          Understanding Human Psychology in Stocks: Why Markets Move Up and Down
        </S.SectionTitle>

        <S.Paragraph>
          The stock market is not a machine. It is the sum of millions of human
          emotions — fear, greed, hope, panic, and excitement — playing out
          every second.
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.Paragraph>
          Prices don't just move because of company performance. They move
          because humans react to news, expectations, rumors, and emotions.
          Understanding psychology is as important as understanding financial
          statements.
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.BulletList>
          <S.BulletItem>
            <strong>Fear:</strong> Bad news or rumors can cause panic selling,
            even if the company's long-term health is fine.
          </S.BulletItem>
          <S.BulletItem>
            <strong>Greed:</strong> Seeing others make fast money can tempt you
            into risky bets, ignoring real fundamentals.
          </S.BulletItem>
          <S.BulletItem>
            <strong>Herd Behavior:</strong> People blindly copy what others are
            doing without thinking logically.
          </S.BulletItem>
          <S.BulletItem>
            <strong>Hope:</strong> Holding onto losing stocks for too long
            because you "hope" they'll recover, even if the company is clearly
            failing.
          </S.BulletItem>
        </S.BulletList>

        <S.Paragraph>
          <strong>How to use psychology to win?</strong>
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.BulletList>
          <S.BulletItem>
            Buy when others are fearful, and prices are low — but only strong
            companies.
          </S.BulletItem>
          <S.BulletItem>
            Control your emotions — don't panic sell or greedy-buy based on
            temporary hype.
          </S.BulletItem>
          <S.BulletItem>
            Make logical, unemotional investment decisions based on facts, not
            feelings.
          </S.BulletItem>
        </S.BulletList>

        <S.Paragraph>
          In short: Markets may fluctuate wildly in the short term — but
          long-term, real business performance always wins. If you stay calm,
          focused, and logical, you automatically gain an edge over 90% of
          emotional traders.

          Risks of Investing in Stocks (And How To Stay Safe)
        </S.SectionTitle>

        <S.Paragraph>
          Stocks can be one of the best ways to build long-term wealth — but
          they are not risk-free. Every investor, beginner or expert, needs to
          understand the kinds of risks involved so you can protect yourself and
          make informed decisions.
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.Paragraph>
          Here are the major risks you must be aware of — especially when
          investing in the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX):
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.BulletList>
          <S.BulletItem>
            <strong>Market Risk:</strong> This is the biggest risk. Economic
            slowdowns, inflation, rising interest rates, currency depreciation,
            or political events (elections, instability, policies) can make the
            overall market fall — dragging even good companies down.
          </S.BulletItem>
          <S.BulletItem>
            <strong>Company Risk:</strong> Even strong companies can fail. Poor
            leadership, fraud, falling profits, or high debt can ruin a
            business. If you invest in one such company, your money is at risk —
            even if the overall market is fine.
          </S.BulletItem>
          <S.BulletItem>
            <strong>Liquidity Risk:</strong> Some small or unknown stocks have
            very few buyers. If you want to sell quickly, you might not find a
            buyer — or might have to sell at a loss.
          </S.BulletItem>
          <S.BulletItem>
            <strong>Manipulation Risk:</strong> In Pakistan, some low-volume
            stocks can be manipulated by large investors or groups
            ("pump-and-dump"). They create artificial hype and then exit —
            leaving retail investors trapped.
          </S.BulletItem>
          <S.BulletItem>
            <strong>Currency & Inflation Risk:</strong> In a country like
            Pakistan, rising inflation and rupee devaluation can affect company
            costs, imports, and real returns — especially if you're planning to
            cash out later.
          </S.BulletItem>
          <S.BulletItem>
            <strong>Emotional Risk:</strong> The most dangerous risk isn't
            external — it's internal. Many investors panic sell when prices
            fall, or become greedy during rallies and over-invest. Emotional
            decisions ruin portfolios.
          </S.BulletItem>
        </S.BulletList>

        <S.Paragraph>
          <strong>So how do you protect yourself?</strong>
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.BulletList>
          <S.BulletItem>
            <strong>Diversify:</strong> Never put all your money in one or two
            stocks. Hold at least 5–10 solid companies across sectors (banking,
            cement, tech, energy, etc.).
          </S.BulletItem>
          <S.BulletItem>
            <strong>Stick to quality:</strong> Choose companies with clean
            balance sheets, strong cash flows, and good management. Avoid hype
            stocks or "penny" shares.
          </S.BulletItem>
          <S.BulletItem>
            <strong>Invest long term:</strong> Don’t try to time the market.
            Hold your investments for 3–5+ years to ride out short-term
            volatility.
          </S.BulletItem>
          <S.BulletItem>
            <strong>Control emotions:</strong> Avoid panic selling during dips
            and don’t overbuy during rallies. Build your portfolio slowly and
            rationally.
          </S.BulletItem>
          <S.BulletItem>
            <strong>Watch your exposure:</strong> Never invest more than you can
            afford to lose. Stocks should be a part of your portfolio, not your
            entire net worth.
          </S.BulletItem>
        </S.BulletList>

        <S.Paragraph>
          Remember: every investment carries risk — even cash loses value to
          inflation. The goal is not to avoid risk entirely, but to understand
          and manage it wisely.
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.Paragraph>
          Smart investors don’t panic. They plan, diversify, and stay the
          course. That’s how wealth is built.

          Tax on Stocks in Pakistan (2025 Updated)
        </S.SectionTitle>

        <S.Paragraph>
          When you earn money from stocks — either by selling at a profit or
          receiving dividends — the government applies taxes. Understanding how
          this works helps you calculate your true returns.
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.Paragraph>
          In Pakistan, two main taxes apply to stock investors:
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.BulletList>
          <S.BulletItem>
            <strong>Capital Gains Tax (CGT):</strong> 15% tax on profits when
            you sell shares at a higher price than you bought them.
          </S.BulletItem>
          <S.BulletItem>
            <strong>Dividend Tax:</strong> 15% tax deducted at source on any
            cash dividends you receive from companies.
          </S.BulletItem>
        </S.BulletList>

        <S.Paragraph>
          You don’t need to worry about filing these separately — your broker
          handles all tax deductions and reports them to the FBR automatically.
          The amounts are deducted before you even see the final payment in your
          bank or trading account.
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.Paragraph>
          Let’s understand this with a real-life example.
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.Paragraph>
          Imagine you bought 100 shares of Meezan Bank (MEBL) at Rs. 100 each in
          January 2023, investing a total of Rs. 10,000.
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.Paragraph>
          In March 2025, the share price rises to Rs. 180, and you decide to
          sell:
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.BulletList>
          <S.BulletItem>
            <strong>Sale proceeds:</strong> 100 × Rs. 180 = Rs. 18,000
          </S.BulletItem>
          <S.BulletItem>
            <strong>Capital gain:</strong> Rs. 18,000 − Rs. 10,000 = Rs. 8,000
          </S.BulletItem>
          <S.BulletItem>
            <strong>CGT @ 15%:</strong> Rs. 1,200 deducted
          </S.BulletItem>
          <S.BulletItem>
            <strong>Net profit:</strong> Rs. 6,800 after tax
          </S.BulletItem>
        </S.BulletList>

        <S.Paragraph>
          Now let’s say during these 2 years, you also received Rs. 6 per share
          in annual dividend — totaling:
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.BulletList>
          <S.BulletItem>
            Rs. 6 × 100 shares × 2 years = Rs. 1,200 gross dividend
          </S.BulletItem>
          <S.BulletItem>15% dividend tax = Rs. 180 deducted</S.BulletItem>
          <S.BulletItem>Net cash received = Rs. 1,020</S.BulletItem>
        </S.BulletList>

        <S.Paragraph>So in total, your return looks like this:</S.Paragraph>

        <S.BulletList>
          <S.BulletItem>
            <strong>Capital gains (after tax):</strong> Rs. 6,800
          </S.BulletItem>
          <S.BulletItem>
            <strong>Dividends (after tax):</strong> Rs. 1,020
          </S.BulletItem>
          <S.BulletItem>
            <strong>Total real profit:</strong> Rs. 7,820 on Rs. 10,000
            investment
          </S.BulletItem>
        </S.BulletList>

        <S.Paragraph>
          That’s a 78.2% return in 2 years — pretty solid. But let’s take this
          one step further.
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.Paragraph>
          If inflation averaged 20% per year in that period, your money lost
          around 44% of its purchasing power. Adjusting for inflation, your{" "}
          <strong>real gain</strong> would be closer to:
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.Paragraph>
          <strong>Real return ≈ 78.2% − 44% = ~34%</strong> over 2 years
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.Paragraph>
          That’s still better than any bank deposit or most mutual funds — and
          it shows why stocks, even after tax and inflation, remain one of the
          best ways to grow wealth in Pakistan.
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.Paragraph>
          Always calculate your{" "}
          <strong>post-tax and inflation-adjusted returns</strong>. That’s the
          number that matters.

        <S.Paragraph>
          Long-term investors who stayed invested in the index have multiplied
          their money by nearly 50x since 2000. This shows the power of patience
          and compounding in the stock market — especially when reinvesting
          dividends along the way.
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.Paragraph>
          While there have been short-term crashes and political uncertainty
          over the years, the long-term trend remains upward. That’s why experts
          say: “Time in the market is more important than timing the market.”

        <S.SectionTitle>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</S.SectionTitle>

        <S.Paragraph>
          Still have questions? Here are some of the most common questions
          Pakistani investors ask — answered clearly and simply.
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.Paragraph>
          <strong>1. Is stock investing halal?</strong>
        </S.Paragraph>
        <S.Paragraph>
          Yes, investing in stocks is considered halal as long as you invest in
          companies whose core businesses are shariah-compliant (i.e., not
          involved in alcohol, gambling, interest-based finance, or unethical
          practices). Many brokers and funds in Pakistan also offer fully
          shariah-screened portfolios.
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.Paragraph>
          <strong>2. How much money do I need to start?</strong>
        </S.Paragraph>
        <S.Paragraph>
          You can start investing with as little as Rs. 5,000. Some shares cost
          less than Rs. 100 per share, so even small capital can get you
          started. Most brokers don’t require a high minimum deposit.
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.Paragraph>
          <strong>3. Can I lose all my money in stocks?</strong>
        </S.Paragraph>
        <S.Paragraph>
          If you blindly follow tips or put all your money in one risky stock,
          yes — you can lose a large portion of your capital. But if you
          research, diversify, and invest in solid companies, the chances of
          losing everything are very low.
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.Paragraph>
          <strong>4. Where can I check live stock prices in Pakistan?</strong>
        </S.Paragraph>
        <S.Paragraph>
          You can check real-time stock prices on the official Pakistan Stock
          Exchange (PSX) website, through your brokerage app, or on platforms
          like Investing.com, TradingView, or Bloomberg.
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.Paragraph>
          <strong>5. Do I need to be an expert to invest?</strong>
        </S.Paragraph>
        <S.Paragraph>
          No. You just need to learn the basics, stay disciplined, and avoid
          emotional decisions. Even working professionals, students, and
          retirees can manage their own stock portfolios with simple tools and
          consistent learning.
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.Paragraph>
          <strong>6. What if I want someone else to manage my money?</strong>
        </S.Paragraph>
        <S.Paragraph>
          You can invest in mutual funds or hire licensed portfolio managers who
          invest on your behalf. Just make sure they are SECP-registered and
          transparent about fees and performance.

          Conclusion: Why Stocks Should Be Your First Choice
        </S.SectionTitle>

        <S.Paragraph>
          Stocks aren’t just for the rich or the risky — they’re for anyone who
          wants to grow their money wisely and beat inflation. In a country like
          Pakistan, where prices rise fast and opportunities are limited, the
          stock market gives you a direct seat at the table of the nation’s
          strongest businesses.
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.Paragraph>
          Whether you're a student with Rs. 5,000 or a working professional with
          savings, stocks let you invest in real companies — banks, cement
          factories, food brands, tech firms — and share in their success. Over
          time, these investments can pay dividends, grow in value, and help you
          achieve goals like buying a home, building savings, or even early
          retirement.
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.Paragraph>
          Yes, there are risks. But those risks can be managed through
          knowledge, patience, and discipline. The biggest risk? Doing nothing
          and letting your money slowly lose value in a bank account.
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.Paragraph>
          You don’t need to be an expert. You just need to begin — slowly,
          wisely, and consistently. That’s where financial freedom starts.
        </S.Paragraph>

        <S.Paragraph>
          <strong>
            So start today. Learn the basics. Make your first trade. Track your
            progress. And grow.
          </strong>
