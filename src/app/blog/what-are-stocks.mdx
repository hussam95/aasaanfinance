  <SectionTitle>What Are Stocks?</SectionTitle>
  <Paragraph>
    Stocks — often called shares or equities — represent your ownership in a
    business. When you buy a stock, you're not just buying a paper or a digital
    number on an app. You're literally becoming a **partial owner** of that
    company. From multinational giants like Nestlé and Engro to IT leaders like
    Systems Limited, you now have a seat at their table — no matter how small.

    Stocks — often called shares or equities — represent your ownership in a
    business. When you buy a stock, you're not just buying a paper or a digital
    number on an app. You're literally becoming a **partial owner** of that
    company.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    This ownership comes with real benefits: if the company grows and becomes
    profitable, you share in that success. Your stock price may rise, and you
    might receive regular income called **dividends**. If the business
    struggles, your investment may lose value — just like any real business
    partnership.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    Think of stocks as owning a slice of a successful bakery. You didn’t bake
    the bread, but you invested your money. As the bakery earns, your piece of
    the pie grows. That’s what stock investing is: **business ownership made
    accessible to everyone**, including you.
  </Paragraph>
</Section>
<Section>
  <SectionTitle>Why Do Companies Issue Stocks?</SectionTitle>
  <Paragraph>
    Businesses need money to grow. Instead of taking loans from banks and paying
    high interest, companies often raise money by selling a piece of themselves
    — their equity — to the public. This process is called going public or
    issuing stocks.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    For example, when Lucky Cement wants to build a new plant or Systems Limited
    wants to expand into Europe, they can raise capital by selling shares. In
    return, investors like you become co-owners, and if the company succeeds,
    you benefit directly. It’s a win-win: companies get funding, and you get
    growth.
  </Paragraph>

  <SectionTitle>How Do Stocks Work?</SectionTitle>
  <Paragraph>
    Stocks are bought and sold on platforms called stock exchanges. In Pakistan,
    this is the **Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX)**. Globally, you might have
    heard of NYSE or NASDAQ. When you place a buy order through a brokerage
    (like AKD, JS Global, or MRA Securities), you're purchasing shares from
    someone who’s selling — all done digitally.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    The price of a stock changes every second based on demand and supply. If a
    company posts high profits, demand rises, and so does the price. If there's
    negative news, more people sell, and the price drops.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    Behind every price is emotion, performance, and perception — and
    understanding that is half the game.

  <SectionTitle>Types of Stocks</SectionTitle>
  <Paragraph>
    All stocks aren't created equal. Knowing the types helps you build a safer
    and smarter portfolio.
  </Paragraph>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Common Stocks:</strong> Most popular. They give you voting rights
      and dividends (if declared), but carry higher risk.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Preferred Stocks:</strong> Usually no voting rights, but offer
      fixed dividends and get paid first during liquidation.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Blue Chip Stocks:</strong> Big, stable companies like HBL or
      Engro. Steady performers with reliable earnings.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Growth Stocks:</strong> Fast-growing companies like SYS or TRG.
      They may not pay dividends but offer massive long-term upside.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Dividend Stocks:</strong> Companies like MEBL or FFC that
      regularly share profits with shareholders.
    </li>
  </ul>
</Section>

<Section>
  <SectionTitle>How Do You Earn From Stocks?</SectionTitle>
  <Paragraph>There are two primary ways to make money from stocks:</Paragraph>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Capital Gains:</strong> Buying low and selling high. For instance,
      if you buy MEBL at Rs. 90 and sell at Rs. 150, you’ve earned Rs. 60 per
      share — that's a capital gain.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Dividends:</strong> Companies that make consistent profits often
      distribute a part to shareholders. If you own 100 shares of a company that
      declares Rs. 5 per share dividend, you get Rs. 500 directly into your bank
      account.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <Paragraph>
    The best part? Many investors reinvest these dividends to buy more shares,
    leading to compound growth over time.

  <SectionTitle>Risks Involved</SectionTitle>
  <Paragraph>
    Stocks can reward you handsomely, but they’re not without risks — especially
    in Pakistan’s volatile environment.
  </Paragraph>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Market Risk:</strong> Political instability or currency
      depreciation can cause prices to fall across the board.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Company Risk:</strong> Mismanagement or fraud in a company can
      lead to sharp losses.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Liquidity Risk:</strong> Some stocks don’t have enough buyers —
      you may not be able to exit quickly.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Emotional Risk:</strong> Panic selling or greedy buying leads many
      beginners to loss.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <Paragraph>
    Risk can't be eliminated — but it can be managed. With education, patience,
    and diversification, you can build a resilient portfolio.

  <SectionTitle>Investing in the Pakistani Stock Market</SectionTitle>
  <Paragraph>To invest in the PSX, you need:</Paragraph>
  <ul>
    <li>A valid CNIC</li>
    <li>A brokerage account (AKD, JS, MRA, etc.)</li>
    <li>A CDC account to hold your shares</li>
    <li>A bank account to fund your trades</li>
  </ul>
  <Paragraph>
    Once set up, you can trade using mobile apps, track live prices, and manage
    your portfolio in real-time. New investors can start with as little as Rs.
    5,000.

  <SectionTitle>Trends and Insights</SectionTitle>
  <Paragraph>
    The PSX has seen booms and crashes. From political shocks to IMF bailouts,
    the market has been through it all. But one trend remains: **long-term
    investors who stay the course usually win.**
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    While some years are tough, patience pays off. Between 2000 and 2023, the
    KSE-100 index grew from around 1,500 points to over 60,000 — a nearly 40x
    return.

  <SectionTitle>Final Thoughts</SectionTitle>
  <Paragraph>
    Stocks are not gambling. They are tools of ownership. They are your ticket
    to join Pakistan’s economic growth — to own banks, tech firms, cement
    giants, and more.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    But they require commitment. Not all days are green, and not every company
    succeeds. That’s why research, diversification, and discipline are
    non-negotiable.
  </Paragraph>
  <Paragraph>
    Start small. Stay consistent. Learn along the way. Let the magic of
    compounding do the rest.
