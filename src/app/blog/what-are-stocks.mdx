  <Paragraph>
    Stocks — also known as shares or equities — represent ownership in a company. But let’s not stop there, because this single sentence hides a powerful idea that fuels economies, builds fortunes, and gives people like you and me a chance to grow wealth alongside the world's biggest businesses.
  </Paragraph>

<Paragraph
  style={{ fontStyle: "italic", fontSize: "0.95rem", textAlign: "center" }}
>
  A stock is a piece of a company you can buy. It makes you a **partial owner**,
  giving you a share in its profits — and its future.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  When a company wants to grow — build factories, hire talent, expand into new
  markets — it often needs more money than it currently has. One way to raise
  this money is by issuing stocks to the public. In return, investors (people
  like you) who buy these stocks become **partial owners** of the business.
</Paragraph>


<Paragraph>
  Think of it like this: imagine a company is a giant pizza. Each slice of the
  pizza is a share. When you buy one slice, you're entitled to enjoy part of
  whatever that pizza earns — be it profits (through dividends), or future value
  (if the pizza grows in size and quality over time). The more slices you own,
  the bigger your voice and share in the company.
</Paragraph>


<Paragraph>
  This isn’t limited to billionaires or financial wizards. Today, anyone with a
  smartphone and a little knowledge can become a shareholder in companies like
  Microsoft, Apple, Unilever, or even local firms listed on the Pakistan Stock
  Exchange like Meezan Bank, Engro, or Lucky Cement.
</Paragraph>


<Paragraph>
  In essence, buying a stock gives you a **seat at the table** of businesses —
  from startups to multinationals — and ties your financial future to their
  performance. When they win, you win. When they struggle, you share that risk
  too.
</Paragraph>


<Paragraph>
  Stocks are the **building blocks of modern investing**. To understand wealth
  creation, economic growth, and even global politics — you need to understand
  what stocks are, how they work, and why they matter.
</Paragraph>


<Paragraph>
  Let’s dive deeper, layer by layer — and turn this powerful concept into
  something you can fully understand, use, and grow from — no matter your age,
  background, or financial status.
</Paragraph>
</Section>
<Section>
  <SectionTitle id="why-do-companies-issue-stocks">Why Do Companies Issue Stocks?</SectionTitle>


<Paragraph>
  Companies issue stocks to raise money. It’s that simple. Instead of borrowing
  from a bank — and paying back with interest — they can raise capital by
  offering the public a chance to buy **equity** in their business.
</Paragraph>
  <BlogImage

  alt="Illustration of stock ownership concept"

<Paragraph
  style={{ fontStyle: "italic", fontSize: "0.95rem", textAlign: "center" }}
>
Companies issue stocks to raise capital without debt — giving the public a stake in their future. This fuels growth, innovation, and shared success between businesses and investors
</Paragraph>


<Paragraph>
  The word **equity** simply means ownership. When a company sells equity, it’s
  giving up a portion of ownership in exchange for money. In return, the people
  who buy that equity — the shareholders — become part-owners of the company.
  These ownership units are what we call **stocks** or **shares**.
</Paragraph>


<Paragraph>
  By issuing equity, the company doesn’t have to pay back any loan. Instead, it
  gets to use the raised money to grow — build factories, launch new products,
  expand operations, or even pay off old debts — while giving investors a chance
  to benefit from that growth.
</Paragraph>


<Paragraph>
  A great real-life example is <strong>Systems Limited</strong>, one of
  Pakistan’s leading IT companies. When it went public on the Pakistan Stock
  Exchange in 2014, it sold equity to the public and raised new funds. That move
  helped the company scale up, expand internationally, and build trust with
  clients worldwide.
</Paragraph>


<Paragraph>
  For investors, it was a golden opportunity. Shares that were originally priced
  around PKR 30 have soared past PKR 600 in less than a decade — delivering
  massive returns. This shows how a company’s growth, funded through equity, can
  reward both the business and its shareholders.
</Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    So when a company issues stocks, it’s not just raising money — it’s sharing its future. The business gets the fuel it needs, and the public gets a seat on the ride. That’s the power of equity.
  </Paragraph>
</Section>


<Section>
  <SectionTitle id="what-happens-when-you-buy-a-stock">What Happens When You Buy a Stock?</SectionTitle>


<Paragraph>
  So, you’ve decided to buy a stock — maybe it’s a tech company you believe in,
  a cement giant you’ve heard about, or a bank you use every day. What actually
  happens when you tap that “Buy” button on your phone or ask your broker to
  place the order?
</Paragraph>


<Paragraph>
  In that moment, you’re buying a **tiny ownership stake** in the company. You
  now hold a share — or more — of that business. It doesn’t matter if you bought
  one share out of millions; you're still legally a **part-owner** of that
  company.
</Paragraph>


<Paragraph>
  This ownership gives you certain **rights and opportunities**:
  <ul>
    <li>
      You’re entitled to a portion of the company’s profits (if they choose to
      share them — more on this in the next section).
    </li>
    <li>
      You benefit if the value of the company goes up — because the stock price
      typically rises with it.
    </li>
    <li>You can vote in important decisions (for some types of stocks).</li>
  </ul>
</Paragraph>


<Paragraph>
  Let’s say you buy 100 shares of <strong>Engro Corporation</strong>. You didn’t
  just buy a digital receipt — you bought a piece of one of Pakistan’s largest
  conglomerates. When Engro performs well, earns profits, or pays out dividends,
  you benefit. If the stock price goes from PKR 250 to PKR 300, your holding
  increases in value by 20%. And if they announce a cash dividend of PKR 10 per
  share, you receive PKR 1,000 — straight into your brokerage account.
</Paragraph>


<Paragraph>
  Of course, owning stock also means taking on **risk**. If the company
  struggles, the share price can fall. Stocks don’t guarantee returns — they
  offer opportunity, but they also involve uncertainty.
</Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    Buying a stock is like planting a seed in a company’s garden. You don’t control the weather or the soil, but if the company grows and thrives — you get to enjoy the fruit.
  </Paragraph>

  <SectionTitle id="how-do-stocks-make-you-money">How Do Stocks Make You Money?</SectionTitle>


<Paragraph>
  Owning a stock isn’t just about having a piece of a company — it’s about
  growing your wealth over time. But how exactly does that happen? There are
  **two main ways stocks make you money**:
</Paragraph>
  <BlogImage
  src="/blog-imgs/what-are-stocks/howDoStocksMakeYouMoney.png"
  alt="Illustration of stock ownership concept"
/>
<Paragraph
  style={{ fontStyle: "italic", fontSize: "0.95rem", textAlign: "center" }}
>
Stocks grow your wealth in two powerful ways: by rising in value over time (capital gains) and by paying you a share of profits (dividends) — making your money work even while you sleep.
</Paragraph>


<Paragraph>
  <strong>1. Capital Gains (Price Appreciation)</strong>
  <br />
  This is the most common and exciting way people make money in the stock
  market. If the value of the company increases — through higher sales, better
  profits, or future growth potential — the **stock price rises**. If you bought
  the stock at a lower price and sell it at a higher price, the difference is
  your profit.
</Paragraph>


<Paragraph>
  For example, if you buy 100 shares of a company at PKR 50 per share, and a few
  months later the price rises to PKR 70, you can sell those shares for a total
  of PKR 7,000. Since you only paid PKR 5,000, you’ve made a **PKR 2,000
  profit**, just by holding the stock.
</Paragraph>


<Paragraph>
  <strong>2. Dividends (Profit Sharing)</strong>
  <br />
  Some companies choose to share a portion of their profits with shareholders.
  This is called a <strong>dividend</strong>. It’s usually paid out in cash —
  directly into your account — based on how many shares you own. Think of it as
  a reward for supporting the company and staying invested.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  For example, if a company announces a cash dividend of  <strong>PKR 5 per share</strong> and you own <strong>300 shares</strong>,
  you’ll receive:
  <br />
  <code>300 shares × PKR 5 = PKR 1,500</code> — without needing to sell
  anything.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  But here’s something many new investors don’t know: when a company pays a
  dividend, the stock price often adjusts on the  <strong>ex-dividend date</strong>. On that day, the stock usually drops by
  roughly the amount of the dividend. Why? Because the value of the company has
  now decreased by the cash it’s paying out.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Let’s say a stock was trading at PKR 120 and the company announces a PKR 5
  dividend. On the ex-dividend date, the price may drop to around PKR 115. You
  haven’t lost money — that PKR 5 has simply moved from your stock value into
  your hands as a cash dividend. So the total value of your investment stays
  nearly the same.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Now let’s walk through a real example. Suppose you invested in  <strong>Meezan Bank</strong> in 2020, buying <strong>500 shares</strong> at
  around PKR 60 per share. Your total investment would be:
  <br />
  <code>500 × 60 = PKR 30,000</code>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Over the next few years, Meezan’s share price gradually rose to over  <strong>PKR 150</strong>. At that price, your holding would now be worth:
  <br />
  <code>500 × 150 = PKR 75,000</code>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  But that’s not all. Suppose Meezan paid an average dividend of  <strong>PKR 5 per share</strong> annually. Over 4 years, you would’ve earned:
  <br />
  <code>500 × 5 × 4 = PKR 10,000 in cash dividends</code>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  So your total return isn’t just a stock price gain of PKR 45,000 — it also
  includes PKR 10,000 in passive income. That’s the power of stocks: they can
  grow in value and <strong>pay you while you wait</strong>.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Dividends may seem small at first, but over time they can become a significant
  income stream — especially if reinvested. In fact, many of the world’s
  wealthiest investors attribute a large part of their success to compounding
  dividends.
</Paragraph>

<Section>
  <SectionTitle id="what-really-moves-a-stocks-price">What Really Moves a Stock’s Price?</SectionTitle>

<Paragraph>
  Stock prices don’t move randomly. Behind every jump or drop in a stock chart,
  there are **real reasons** — and they often have less to do with just numbers,
  and more to do with how people think, feel, and react. Understanding this is
  key to becoming a confident investor.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph

Stock prices don’t just follow numbers — they follow human behavior, expectations, and patterns. This infographic breaks it down into three simple forces: fundamentals, technicals, and psychology — the real engine, waves, and weather behind every price move.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  At the core, a stock’s price is driven by one powerful force:  <strong>supply and demand</strong>. If more people want to buy a stock
  (demand) than sell it (supply), the price goes up. If more people want to sell
  than buy, the price goes down. Simple — but what causes that buying or
  selling? That’s where it gets interesting.
</Paragraph>


<Paragraph>Let’s explore the 3 big forces behind price movements:</Paragraph>


<Paragraph>
  <strong>1. Fundamentals: How strong is the company?</strong>
  <br />
  This includes everything from sales, profits, debt levels, future growth
  plans, and market position. If a company shows strong results — like higher
  quarterly earnings, new product launches, or a big export deal — investors
  feel confident, and demand for its stock rises, pushing the price up. Weak
  financials or scandals do the opposite.
</Paragraph>


<Paragraph>
  <strong>2. Technicals: What is the price chart telling us?</strong>
  <br />
  Many investors study price charts to spot patterns, trends, and key levels
  like support and resistance. Even though technical analysis doesn’t focus on
  the company itself, it reflects **how other investors are behaving**. When a
  stock breaks above a past high, it may trigger excitement (called a breakout).
  If it falls below a key level, panic selling can follow.
</Paragraph>


<Paragraph>
  <strong>3. Psychology: Fear, Greed, and Market Mood</strong>
  <br />
  Markets are driven by human emotion. Sometimes stocks rise just because
  everyone believes they will — and they fall because everyone panics. If
  investors feel optimistic about the economy or a sector, they buy. If there's
  fear (like during political instability or inflation scares), they sell — even
  if the company is doing fine. This is why good stocks sometimes fall, and bad
  ones sometimes rise.
</Paragraph>


<Paragraph>
  Picture a stock like a boat on water. Fundamentals are the engine, technicals
  are the waves, and psychology is the weather. Sometimes the engine is strong,
  but rough waves or a sudden storm (bad news or fear) can rock the boat.
</Paragraph>


<Paragraph>
  For example, a fundamentally strong company like <strong>Lucky Cement</strong>  might fall in price if political tension creates fear across the entire
  market. At the same time, a weak stock might rise for a few days simply
  because social media hype triggered a rush of buyers. This is why experienced
  investors look at <em>all three forces</em> before making a decision — not
  just charts, and not just numbers.
</Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    In the end, stock prices move because of people — their expectations, emotions, beliefs, and behaviors. The more you understand these forces, the less you’ll panic when prices move, and the better your investing decisions will be.
  </Paragraph>
</Section>
<Section>
  <SectionTitle id="what-are-the-risks-of-investing-in-stocks">What Are the Risks of Investing in Stocks?</SectionTitle>


<Paragraph>
  Stocks can build wealth — but they can also shrink it. As powerful as stocks
  are for long-term growth, they come with risks that every investor must
  understand before putting money in. The more realistic your expectations, the
  smarter your decisions will be.
</Paragraph>
<BlogImage
  src="/blog-imgs/what-are-stocks/risksOfInvestingInStocks.png"
  alt="Illustration of stock ownership concept"
/>
<Paragraph
  style={{ fontStyle: "italic", fontSize: "0.95rem", textAlign: "center" }}
>
Stocks offer growth — but not without risks. From market swings and poor company decisions to emotional panic and low liquidity, understanding these challenges is key to smart, long-term investing.
</Paragraph>


<Paragraph>
  <strong>1. Market Risk: Prices Can Go Down</strong>
  <br />
  Stock prices rise — but they also fall. Sometimes it’s because of
  company-specific news, and sometimes it’s due to broader economic events like
  inflation, political instability, or global recessions. Even strong companies
  see their stock prices drop in rough times. If you panic and sell during a
  dip, you lock in losses.
</Paragraph>


<Paragraph>
  For example, in 2022, the Pakistan Stock Exchange fell sharply amid political
  uncertainty. Even good companies like <strong>HBL</strong> and  <strong>MCB</strong> saw their stock prices decline — not because they were
  doing poorly, but because overall investor sentiment was shaken.
</Paragraph>


<Paragraph>
  <strong>2. Company Risk: Not Every Business Wins</strong>
  <br />
  Just because a company is listed on the stock exchange doesn’t guarantee it
  will succeed. Businesses can make poor decisions, face unexpected competition,
  or mismanage their finances. If a company’s performance declines long-term,
  its stock price may never recover.
</Paragraph>


<Paragraph>
  Take the case of <strong>K-Electric</strong>. At one point, it was one of the
  most talked-about stocks due to privatization and expected reforms. But due to
  regulatory issues, stalled tariffs, and poor investor communication, the stock
  remained stagnant or fell for years — frustrating many who bought in on hype.
</Paragraph>


<Paragraph>
  <strong>3. Emotional Risk: The Human Factor</strong>
  <br />
  Many people lose money not because the company failed — but because they
  couldn’t control their emotions. Fear makes you sell too early. Greed makes
  you hold too long. Impatience pushes you to chase risky stocks or try to time
  the market. Successful investing isn’t just about numbers — it’s about
  managing your mindset.
</Paragraph>


<Paragraph>
  <strong>4. Liquidity Risk: Can You Exit When You Want?</strong>
  <br />
  Some stocks on the Pakistan Stock Exchange are thinly traded — meaning very
  few people buy or sell them daily. If you want to exit your position, you
  might not find a buyer easily, or you may be forced to sell at a lower price.
</Paragraph>


<Paragraph>
  <strong>5. No Guaranteed Returns</strong>
  <br />
  Unlike a fixed deposit or a government bond, stocks don’t promise you any
  fixed return. Dividends can be skipped. Prices can fall. Even if you hold for
  years, returns are not guaranteed — they depend on the company’s performance
  and market conditions.
</Paragraph>


<Paragraph>
  That said, most of these risks can be managed — with patience, research,
  diversification, and a long-term mindset. Investing blindly is risky. But
  investing wisely is empowering.
</Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    The goal is not to avoid risk — it's to understand it. Because in the stock market, knowledge is your real safety net.
  </Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Not all stocks are the same. Just like there are different types of cars —
  economy, luxury, SUV, electric — stocks also come in different categories,
  based on what they offer and how they behave. Understanding these types helps
  you build a smarter portfolio.

From blue-chip giants to high-risk penny stocks — this guide breaks down the main types of stocks every investor should know.
</Paragraph>


<Paragraph>Let’s break them down into two key layers:</Paragraph>


<Paragraph>
  <strong>1. Based on Ownership Rights</strong>
  <br />
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Common Stocks:</strong> This is what most people buy. You get
      ownership, voting rights (in some cases), and the chance to earn from
      dividends and price increases. But if the company goes bankrupt, you're
      last in line to get paid.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Preferred Stocks:</strong> Less common for everyday investors.
      These don’t usually come with voting rights, but they offer **fixed
      dividend payments** and priority over common shareholders in case of
      liquidation. They act more like a mix of stocks and bonds.
    </li>
  </ul>
</Paragraph>


<Paragraph>
  <strong>2. Based on Investment Style</strong>
  <br />
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Blue-Chip Stocks:</strong> Big, established, and reliable
      companies with a history of stable performance. Think      <strong>Engro, MCB, Lucky Cement, or Meezan Bank</strong>. These are great
      for long-term, low-stress investing.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Growth Stocks:</strong> These are companies expected to grow
      faster than average. They often reinvest profits instead of paying
      dividends. In Pakistan, tech firms like <strong>Systems Limited</strong>      or <strong>TPL Trakker</strong> may fall into this category.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Dividend Stocks:</strong> Stocks known for paying regular cash
      dividends. Ideal for those looking for passive income. Examples include      <strong>Hub Power Company</strong> or <strong>United Bank Limited</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Penny Stocks:</strong> Low-priced stocks (often under PKR 10–15)
      with small market caps and high risk. These can deliver huge gains — or
      massive losses. Invest here only if you understand the risk and can afford
      the loss.
    </li>
  </ul>
</Paragraph>


<Paragraph>
  Most Pakistani investors start with **blue-chip** and **dividend-paying**
  stocks — they’re easier to trust, easier to understand, and less volatile than
  penny or speculative stocks.
</Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    As you grow in confidence and experience, you can explore a mix of stock types to match your goals — whether it’s safety, growth, or income.

This infographic reveals how taxes and inflation impact your investment returns — and why sitting on cash can silently shrink your wealth over time.
</Paragraph>


  <Paragraph>
    Let’s go back to our earlier example: you bought <strong>500 shares of Meezan Bank</strong> in 2020 at PKR 60 each. That’s a PKR 30,000 investment.
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    By 2024, the stock rises to PKR 150. You now have PKR 75,000 worth of shares — a capital gain of PKR 45,000. You also received an average dividend of PKR 5 per share for 4 years:
    <br />
    <code>500 × 5 × 4 = PKR 10,000</code>
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    So your total gain is:
    <br />
    <code>PKR 45,000 (gain) + PKR 10,000 (dividends) = PKR 55,000</code>
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    Now apply taxes:
  </Paragraph>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Capital Gains Tax (CGT):</strong> 15% of PKR 45,000 = PKR 6,750</li>
    <li><strong>Dividend Tax:</strong> 15% of PKR 10,000 = PKR 1,500</li>
  </ul>

  <Paragraph>
    <strong>Net return after tax: PKR 46,750</strong>
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    Now let’s talk about inflation. From 2020 to 2024, average inflation in Pakistan hovered around 20% per year. That means:
    <br />
    <code>PKR 30,000 in 2020 ≈ PKR 62,000 in 2024 terms</code>
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    Even after inflation, your stock investment grew beyond that — ending up around PKR 75,000. And you collected real cash dividends on top.
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    Now compare this with someone who kept PKR 30,000 in cash or a basic savings account. After 4 years, that money would barely buy what PKR 15,000 could in 2020. In other words, they got poorer without even realizing it.
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    <strong>This is why investing isn’t optional anymore — it’s essential.</strong> You don’t invest to get rich overnight. You invest to protect your money from silently shrinking — and to give it a chance to grow.

Stocks aren’t just assets — they’re opportunities. Start small, stay consistent, and let your money grow with purpose.
</Paragraph>  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    In this guide, we explored what stocks are, why companies issue them, how investors make money, what drives stock prices, the risks involved, the impact of taxes and inflation — and most importantly, how to get started in Pakistan.
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    Yes, stocks carry risk. But so does doing nothing. Leaving your money in cash while inflation eats away at it is also a risk — just one that feels quieter. Over time, the stock market has proven to be one of the most powerful ways to build long-term wealth, even in uncertain economies like ours.
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    You don’t need to be rich to invest. You don’t need a finance degree. You just need to start small, stay consistent, and keep learning.
  </Paragraph>

  <Paragraph>
    So whether you’re 18 or 58 — the best time to start investing was yesterday. The second-best time is <strong>right now</strong>.
